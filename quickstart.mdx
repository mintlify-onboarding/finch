description: "To get started, sign up for a free account at https://dashboard.tryfinch.com/signup. After registration, you will have access to a sandbox application `client_id` and `client_secret` to build and test how Finch works using simulated data."
---

<Note>This `client_id` and `client_secret` will only work for the sandbox provider. If you would like to test real providers with live data, you must request developer keys from developers@tryfinch.com.</Note>

This guide will help you send your first request to Finch's API while the following guides dive deeper into the concepts and help you integrate Finch into your production application.

## Open Finch Connect in sandbox mode

Finch Connect provides a secure and elegant authorization flow for your users to grant your application access to their systems.

<Warning >Note: this quickstart guide is a simplified, but manual way of generating an authorization `code` and exchanging it for an `access_token`, which can be used to subsequently call our APIs. In a true production environment, you will want to automate this process completely inside your application's code.</Warning>

Since this quickstart assumes you have not built an application yet, we must make sure that a proper `redirect_uri` is set up before continuing or our authorization code generation will fail. In your [Finch Dashboard](https://dashboard.tryfinch.com/signup), go to the "Redirect URIs" section and select `+ Add Redirect URI`. We are going to use https://example.com for testing purposes. In production, you will want to use your own application's urls for the Redirect Uris (and remove all mentions of https://example.com or http://localhost).

Redirect URIs are only needed if you are redirecting to Finch Connect. If you decide to use our embedded Finch Connect flow, you do not need to specify a redirect_uri; the SDK does this for you.

We will launch Finch Connect - our secure and elegant authorization flow for your users to grant your application access to their systems - by constructing and navigating to the following URL on your browser. Copy the url below, open up your favorite text editor (Notes, TextEdit, VS Code, etc), paste, and replace `<your_client_id>` with the client id found in your [Finch Dashboard](https://dashboard.tryfinch.com/signup). Remove the angle brackets when replacing `<your_client_id>`.

```cs
https://connect.tryfinch.com/authorize?
&client_id=<your_client_id>
&products=company directory individual employment payment pay_statement
&redirect_uri=https://example.com
&sandbox=true
```

<Note>Note that we have `sandbox=true`. This is required only when calling our sandbox environment for testing purposes.</Note>

## Log in to the Finch sandbox account

Click on the Finch Sandbox mock provider on the selector page and log in with the username `largeco` and password `letmein`. Visit Finch Sandbox for more information on the various types of mock payroll providers you can test.https://developer.tryfinch.com/docs/documentation/cmlh3anpgti5n-quickstart#exchange-the-authorization-code-for-an-access-token

## Exchange the authorization code for an access token

After successfully logging in via Finch Connect, your browser will be redirected to `https://example.com` with the query parameter `code` in the browser URL. Copy the `code` from the url and save it in your text editor. In a production system, however, the browser will redirect to your url and your application will automatically copy the `code` and perform the remaining steps programmatically.

To exchange the `code` for a token, we use the `curl` command below. Copy the code below, paste into your text editor, replace the `<your_authorization_code>` in the command with the one you saved above (making sure to not include the angle brackets).
